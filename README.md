## JuliaOptimizationDays2024

This repository hosts material used for the workshop titled *Demystifying metaprogramming and package precompilation*, given by CÃ©dric Belmant during the Julia Optimization Days 2024.

This workshop was based on Julia 1.11.

## Resources

To get more familiar with the intricacies of metaprogramming, do not hesitate to consult the [official documentation on metaprogramming](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming), which provides a good starting point.

These are great documentation pages that go in depth about package precompilation and invalidations:
- The PrecompileTools.jl [official documentation](https://julialang.github.io/PrecompileTools.jl)
- The SnoopCompile.jl [tutorial on invalidations](https://timholy.github.io/SnoopCompile.jl/stable/tutorials/invalidations/)
